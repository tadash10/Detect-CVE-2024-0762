# Detect-CVE-2024-0762
Detecting vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-0762, particularly in UEFI firmware, is quite challenging due to the low-level natureof the firmware and its interactions with the system. This vulnerability is related to the UEFI firmware itself, so traditional file-based malware detection approaches using hashes from sources like MalwareBazaar or VirusTotal are not directly applicable here.
Steps to Detect CVE-2024-0762

    Firmware Version Check: The most effective way to detect if a system is vulnerable to CVE-2024-0762 is to check the version of the UEFI firmware. This involves querying the firmware version and comparing it with known vulnerable versions.

    Vendor and Model-Specific Detection: The detection script will need to consider the specific vendors and models affected by the vulnerability. Firmware versioning can vary between vendors, so the script should handle different methods of retrieving and checking firmware versions.

    Potential Indicators: Look for specific indicators in the firmware or system configuration that might suggest the presence of an exploitation attempt.

This  Python script that provides a basic framework for detecting CVE-2024-0762 by checking the UEFI firmware version. This script is intended for educational purposes and might need adjustments based on the actual environment and firmware querying methods.
