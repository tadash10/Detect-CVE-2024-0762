# CVE-2024-0762 Detection and Malware Analysis Script

## Overview

This script is designed to detect UEFI firmware versions and assess them for vulnerabilities related to CVE-2024-0762. Additionally, it integrates with the VirusTotal API to analyze files for malware, providing comprehensive security insights:

## Features

- **UEFI Firmware Detection**: Retrieves the UEFI firmware version from Windows and Linux systems.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Checks if the detected firmware version is vulnerable to CVE-2024-0762.
- **VirusTotal Integration**: Submits files to VirusTotal for malware analysis and retrieves detailed reports.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3 is installed.
- **Requests Library**: Required for making HTTP requests to the VirusTotal API.
  ```bash
  pip install requests

Setup

    Obtain a VirusTotal API Key:
        Register at VirusTotal and obtain your API key.

    Configure API Key:
        Replace 'your_api_key' in the script with your actual VirusTotal API key. Consider storing it in an environment variable or secure location.

    Set File Path:
        Update the file_path variable in the script to point to the file you want to analyze.

Usage

    Save the Script:
        Save the script to a file, e.g., cve_2024_0762_detection.py.

    Run the Script:
        Execute the script using Python:
        python cve_2024_0762_detection.py

            Review Results:
        The script will output the detected UEFI firmware version and indicate if it is vulnerable to CVE-2024-0762.
        If a vulnerability is detected, the script submits the specified file to VirusTotal and displays the analysis report.

Script Functions

    execute_command(command): Executes a system command and returns the output. Handles errors and logs failures.
    get_uefi_version(): Retrieves the UEFI firmware version based on the operating system (Windows or Linux).
    check_vulnerability(version): Checks if the retrieved firmware version is listed as vulnerable.
    submit_to_virustotal(file_path): Uploads a file to VirusTotal and returns the file ID.
    get_virustotal_report(file_id): Retrieves the analysis report for a submitted file from VirusTotal.
    main(): Coordinates the detection and analysis processes.

Error Handling

    Logs detailed error messages for command execution failures and API request issues.
    Ensures graceful exit with meaningful error information.

Security Considerations

    API Key Management: Securely manage your API key and avoid hardcoding it in the script. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
    Data Handling: Ensure that sensitive data, including API responses and logs, is handled and stored securely.
